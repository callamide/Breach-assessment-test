Breach Test Plan Document

1. Project Overview

Breach is a web-based platform designed to empower authors and content creators by granting them ownership of their publications. It also provides readers with personalized blog content based on their interests.

This test plan outlines a structured approach to evaluate the Breach application, focusing on functional validation, user experience, and defect identification. It includes the overall testing methodology, scope, tools, and expected deliverables.

Objective: To identify usability issues, bugs, and unexpected behaviors through exploratory testing in the absence of formal specifications or documentation.

Application Type: Web Application / API

2. Testing Objectives
 Understand and validate core user workflows and functionalities.
Detect bugs, inconsistencies, and UX/UI issues.
Identify incomplete, broken, or poorly implemented features.
Lay the groundwork for future structured testing, including test cases and scripts.

3. Scope of Testing

Testing will focus on core functionalities accessible via the user interface and available APIs. Key areas under assessment include
 User registration and login processes
Navigation structure and page interactions
Data input fields and form validation
API endpoint functionality (where applicable, using tools like Postman)
Error handling, validation feedback, and edge case coverage
Basic performance and responsiveness testing (on request)

Out of Scope
Security testing 
Compliance and legal/regulatory validation
Accessibility (unless issues are incidentally identified)

5. Test Approach

Exploratory Sessions: Time-boxed testing sessions using charters focused on specific functionalities.
Session Reporting: Detailed notes, observations, and findings will be captured during each session.
Bug Documentation: Issues encountered will be documented promptly, including reproduction steps and severity ratings.
Test Development: Initial structured test cases will be drafted based on discoveries made during exploratory sessions.
